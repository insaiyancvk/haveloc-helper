# Haveloc Helper

It's a simple python code inspired by the trash UI/UX of a job application platform haveloc. 
Uses selenium web driver and automates a lot of tedious work

Current features:
  - Export all company data as csv file
  - Direct to job application pages

Plans:
  - Create a local json file that stores user's haveloc credentials
  - Improve UI/UX
  - Get the page size based on total current companies
